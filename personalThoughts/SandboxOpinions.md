# Favourite Sandbox
In terms of online labs, my favourite is probably "Infection with Cobalt Strike" on LetsDefend. It was my first experience learning about Cobalt Strike which led me down one of my favourite rabbit holes regarding C2 infrastructure usage in attacks and payload disguising/ detection. Otherwise, my favourite personal sandbox of two was a virtual environment using VULTR that had multiple servers and computers on a shared network integrated with an ELK stack that had dashboard and alerts, a ticketing system, and automatic logs. Additionally, it was a great playground for a hostile C2 server where I got to firsthand see the tools for payload generation and the diversity of attack avenues via different agents and vulnerabilities.
